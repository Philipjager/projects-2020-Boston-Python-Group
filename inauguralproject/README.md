# Inaugural project

In this project we seek to solve the Labor Supply Problem. 

- We first import the needed packages and write up the given equations from the problem and use the optimize.maximize with a wage value of 1, to find the optimal value of l that maximizes the utility function of the consumer.

- We plot the optimal labor supply and consumption for different wages using the optimizer in the range [0.5, 1.5]. 

- To calculate the total tax revenue we 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
