Our project is titled **Medicine_Prices**.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running our Python-file and solution guide.

This **loades three datasets**:

1. medicinpriser_1.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanekn.dk
1. medicinpriser_2.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanekn.dk
1. substitutiongroups.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanekn.dk

For the assignment we have used the packages:

#Packages
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('seaborn-whitegrid')

# Directory

# Focus of project

 
Our project is focussing on finding the trend in various painkiller and their prices. 
This has been done after the merges of the three datasets from above and the new dataset has been cleaned only to include 
the relevant painkillers, which is used in the graphic analysis. 

From our analysis, we focus on a few painkillers. With these, we have chosen to make a few simple plots to show the trend in 
prices over 5 years. These plots will show that the prices on painkillers vary a lot and in some periods is above and below 
the average price from this period.
